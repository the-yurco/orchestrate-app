# Orchestrate - Simple File Management Website

Orchestrate is a simple file management website built using React. 
It allows users to create folders and text files (.txt, .md, .docs) directly in the browser. 
Users can also upload pictures and text files, although uploading docs text files is not recommended due to potential compatibility issues.

All data management is handled through local storage, meaning that files and folders are stored locally in the user's browser.

## Usage

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd orchestrate-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

The website will be running in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can now create folders, add text files, and upload pictures directly through the interface.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run eject`: Ejects from Create React App, giving full control over configuration.
